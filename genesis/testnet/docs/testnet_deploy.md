# Gravity Node Deployment Guide

This document describes how to deploy a new Gravity node and join an existing network. Two deployment modes are supported:

| Mode | cluster.toml `role` | Generated Config | Description |
|------|---------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Validator** | `validator` | `validator.yaml` | Deploys directly as a validator; no config changes needed after join |
| **VFN** | `vfn` | `validator_full_node.yaml` | Runs as a full node first; manual config changes required after join |

> [!TIP]
> The **Validator mode** is recommended — the deployment process is simpler and requires no additional configuration changes after joining.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Running Gravity network**: At least 3 Genesis validator nodes must be running

   | Node ID | Server | IP |
   |---------|--------|------|
   | node1 | gravity-testnet-node-oregon-0 | 34.83.28.182 |
   | node2 | gravity-testnet-node-oregon-1 | 34.83.9.159 |
   | node3 | gravity-testnet-node-losangeles | 34.94.164.9 |

2. **New node server**: Dependencies installed and binaries compiled

## Environment Setup

System dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    clang llvm build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libudev-dev \
    procps git jq curl python3 python3-pip python3-venv \
    nodejs npm protobuf-compiler bc gettext-base
```

Toolchain:
- **Rust**: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- **Foundry**: `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && foundryup`

---

3. **Build binaries**:
   ```bash
   RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo build --profile quick-release -p gravity_node -p gravity_cli
   ```
4. **Network connectivity**: The new node must be able to reach existing nodes' P2P ports (default 6180/6190)
5. **Funded account**: An EVM account for staking (needs sufficient balance for gas + stake amount)

---

## Step 1: Obtain Genesis Files

Get the following two files from the `genesis/testnet/` directory of this repository:

- [`genesis.json`](../genesis.json)
- [`waypoint.txt`](../waypoint.txt)

## Step 2: Configure cluster.toml

Create `cluster.toml` in the `gravity-sdk/cluster/` directory on the new node:

```toml
[cluster]
name = "my-validator"                   # ← Change: cluster name
base_dir = "/home/gravity/gravity-testnet"  # ← Change: deployment directory

[build]
binary_path = "../target/quick-release/gravity_node"  # ← Change: binary path

[genesis_source]
genesis_path = "./output/genesis.json"   # ← Change: genesis file path
waypoint_path = "./output/waypoint.txt"  # ← Change: waypoint file path

[[nodes]]
id = "my-node"
role = "validator"                      # or "vfn"
host = "<YOUR_IP>"                      # Node IP (reachable by other validators)
p2p_port = 6180
vfn_port = 6190
rpc_port = 8545
metrics_port = 9001
inspection_port = 10000
https_port = 1024
authrpc_port = 8551
reth_p2p_port = 12024
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Validator mode**: `role = "validator"` — deploy generates `validator.yaml` config with a `validator_network` section
> - **VFN mode**: `role = "vfn"` — deploy generates `validator_full_node.yaml` config with `base.role` set to `full_node`

> [!NOTE]
> When a node is started with **Validator mode** config, transactions sent to this validator's RPC will **not** be forwarded to the network until the node has synced to the epoch in which it joins the validator set. Once the node reaches that epoch, transactions will automatically be packaged and forwarded via **Quorum Store**.

## Step 3: Configure Relayer (Validator mode only)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Validator nodes** participate in Oracle consensus and must configure the relayer with an RPC provider for each monitored source chain. If you are running in **VFN mode**, skip this step.

The default template at `cluster/templates/relayer_config.json.tpl` is **only an example**. Before deploying, edit this template to use an RPC endpoint geographically close to your node for optimal latency and reliability.

Edit `cluster/templates/relayer_config.json.tpl`:

```json
{
  "uri_mappings": {
    "gravity://0/11155111/events?contract=0x60fD4D8fB846D95CcDB1B0b81c5fed1e8b183375&eventSignature=0x5646e682c7d994bf11f5a2c8addb60d03c83cda3b65025a826346589df43406e&fromBlock=10231540": "<YOUR_SEPOLIA_RPC_ENDPOINT>"
  }
}
```

**Currently monitored chain**: Ethereum Sepolia testnet (chain ID `11155111`).

Replace `<YOUR_SEPOLIA_RPC_ENDPOINT>` with your preferred Sepolia RPC URL, e.g.:
- `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<API_KEY>`
- `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<API_KEY>`
- Any other Sepolia-compatible RPC provider

> [!TIP]
> The Gravity URI in the key must remain **exactly as shown** — only change the RPC endpoint value. Use a provider with stable uptime and low latency to your node, as this directly affects Oracle consensus performance.

## Step 4: Initialize and Deploy

```bash
cd gravity-sdk/cluster
make init      # Generates identity (consensus_public_key + network_public_key)
make deploy    # Generates runtime config and startup scripts
```

`make deploy` will automatically copy the relayer template to each node's config directory as `relayer_config.json`.

Directory structure after deployment:

```
/home/gravity/gravity-testnet/
├── genesis.json
├── gravity_node
├── gravity_cli
└── my-node/
    ├── config/
    │   ├── validator.yaml              # Validator mode
    │   │   (or validator_full_node.yaml)  # VFN mode
    │   ├── identity.yaml
    │   ├── reth_config.json
    │   ├── relayer_config.json          # ← from your configured template
    │   └── waypoint.txt
    ├── script/
    │   ├── start.sh
    │   └── stop.sh
    ├── data/
    ├── logs/
    ├── execution_logs/
    └── consensus_log/
```

## Step 5: Start the Node

```bash
cd /home/gravity/gravity-testnet/my-node/script
./start.sh
```

## Step 6: Verify the Node is Running

```bash
# Check process
ps aux | grep gravity_node

# View logs (you should see blocks being synced)
tail -f /home/gravity/gravity-testnet/my-node/execution_logs/<chain_id>/reth.log
```

After starting, the node will automatically sync data from the network.

- **Validator mode**: The node already has validator config. After completing [Join Validator Set](testnet_join.md), it can participate in consensus
- **VFN mode**: The node runs as a full node providing RPC services but not participating in consensus. After completing [Join Validator Set](testnet_join.md), additional config changes are required

---

## Next Steps

After node deployment is complete, refer to the **[Join Validator Set Guide](testnet_join.md)** to finish on-chain registration and joining.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Node cannot sync | Verify genesis.json and waypoint.txt match the network |
| On-chain shows `YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` | Placeholder was used in network address; currently requires leave → re-register + join |
